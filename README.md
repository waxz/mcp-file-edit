## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrickomatik/mcp-file-edit.git
cd mcp-file-edit
uv pip install -e .
```

### Using pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrickomatik/mcp-file-edit.git
cd mcp-file-edit
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 0. Test
- start http server
```bash
python ./server.py -t http -P 7000 -H 0.0.0.0 -p /mcp
```
- run test
```bash
python ./test.py
```

### 1. Configure Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "file-edit": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp", "run", "/path/to/mcp-file-edit/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with Python directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "file-edit": {
      "command": "/path/to/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-file-edit/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## Usage Guide

### Project Directory (Recommended)

Set a project directory first to use relative paths:

```python
LLM chat session
>>> Use file-edit-mcp to set project directory to /User/fred/project
```


```python
# Set project directory
set_project_directory("/path/to/your/project")

# Now use simple relative paths
read_file("src/main.py")              # Reads from project/src/main.py
write_file("docs/README.md", content) # Writes to project/docs/README.md
list_files("tests")                   # Lists files in project/tests
```

### Basic File Operations


```python
LLM chat session
>>> Use file-edit-mcp to read the file example.txt
```

```python
# Read a file
content = read_file("example.txt")

# Write a file
write_file("output.txt", "Hello, World!")

# Delete a file
delete_file("old_file.txt")


```python
LLM chat session
>>> Use file-edit-mcp to delete the file old_file.txt
```

# Move/rename a file
move_file("old_name.txt", "new_name.txt")


```python
LLM chat session
>>> Use file-edit-mcp to rename old_name to new_name
```

# Copy a file
copy_file("source.txt", "destination.txt")
```


```python
LLM chat session
>>> Use file-edit-mcp to set copy the file source to destination
```

### Search and Replace

Claude should discover and use these functions as part of a wider remit, for example whilst writing new source code to your specification.
They can also be used for manual search and replace operations like this:

```python
LLM chat session
>>> Use file-edit-mcp to find all TODO occurrences and summarise here.
```

```python
# Search for patterns
results = search_files(
    pattern="TODO|FIXME",
    path="src",
    recursive=True,
    max_depth=3
)

# Replace across files
replace_in_files(
    search="old_function",
    replace="new_function",
    path=".",
    file_pattern="*.py"
)
```

### Advanced Patching

Claude should discover and use these functions as part of a wider remit, for example whilst amending source code to fix issues discovered in testing of it's own code.

```python
# Line-based patch
patch_file("config.json", patches=[
    {"line": 5, "content": '    "debug": true,'}
])

# Pattern-based patch
patch_file("main.py", patches=[
    {"find": "import old", "replace": "import new"}
])

# Context-based patch (safer)
patch_file("app.py", patches=[{
    "context": ["def process():", "    return None"],
    "replace": ["def process():", "    return result"]
}])
```

### Code Analysis

```python
# List all functions in a file
functions = list_functions("mycode.py")
# Returns function names, signatures, line numbers, docstrings

# Find function at specific line
func = get_function_at_line("mycode.py", 42)
# Returns the function containing line 42

# Get complete code structure
structure = get_code_structure("mycode.py")
# Returns imports, classes, functions, and more

# Search for functions by pattern
results = search_functions("test_.*", "tests/", "*.py")
# Finds all test functions

## Available Tools

### File Operations
- `read_file` - Read file contents with optional line range
- `write_file` - Write content to a file  
- `create_file` - Create a new file
- `delete_file` - Delete a file or directory
- `move_file` - Move or rename files
- `copy_file` - Copy files or directories

### Directory Operations
- `list_files` - List files with glob patterns and depth control
- `get_file_info` - Get detailed file metadata

### Search and Modification
- `search_files` - Search for patterns with regex support
- `replace_in_files` - Find and replace across multiple files
- `patch_file` - Apply precise modifications to files

### Project Management
- `set_project_directory` - Set the working directory context
- `get_project_directory` - Get current project directory

### Code Analysis- `list_functions` - List all functions in a code file with signatures and line numbers- `get_function_at_line` - Find which function contains a specific line- `get_code_structure` - Extract complete code structure (imports, classes, functions)- `search_functions` - Search for functions by name pattern across files

## Safety Features
- **Path Traversal Protection**: All paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Project Boundary Enforcement**: Operations are restricted to the base directory
- **Backup Creation**: Automatic backups before modifications (configurable)
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing patch applications

### SSH Support

The file editor now supports SSH connections for remote filesystem operations:

```python
# Connect to a remote server using SSH URL format
set_project_directory("ssh://user@example.com:22/home/user/project")

# Or specify SSH parameters explicitly
set_project_directory(
    path="/home/user/project",
    connection_type="ssh",
    ssh_host="example.com",
    ssh_username="user",
    ssh_port=22,
    ssh_key_filename="~/.ssh/id_rsa"  # Optional, defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
)

# All file operations now work on the remote server
files = list_files("src")  # Lists files on remote server
content = read_file("config.json")  # Reads from remote server
write_file("output.txt", "Remote content")  # Writes to remote server

# Switch back to local filesystem
set_project_directory("/local/path", connection_type="local")
```

#### SSH File Transfer Operations

Transfer files between local and remote filesystems:

```python
# First, establish SSH connection
set_project_directory(
    path="/remote/project",
    connection_type="ssh",
    ssh_host="example.com",
    ssh_username="user"
)

# Upload a single file
result = ssh_upload(
    local_path="/local/file.txt",
    remote_path="uploads/file.txt"
)

# Upload a directory recursively
result = ssh_upload(
    local_path="/local/project",
    remote_path="/remote/backup",
    recursive=True,
    overwrite=True
)

# Download a file
result = ssh_download(
    remote_path="data/report.pdf",
    local_path="/local/downloads/report.pdf"
)

# Download a directory
result = ssh_download(
    remote_path="/remote/logs",
    local_path="/local/logs_backup",
    recursive=True
)

# Sync directories using rsync for efficiency
result = ssh_sync(
    local_path="/local/source",
    remote_path="/remote/mirror",
    direction="upload",       # or "download"
    delete=False,             # Don't delete extra files in destination
    update_only=True,         # Only update if source is newer (default)
    show_progress=True,       # Show rsync progress output (default)
    exclude_patterns=[        # Patterns to exclude from sync
        "*.log",
        "*.tmp",
        "node_modules/",
        ".git/"
    ]
)

### Git Operations

The file editor provides comprehensive git support for both local and remote repositories:

```python
# Check git status
status = git_status()
# Shows: branch, staged files, modified files, untracked files

# Initialize a new repository
git_init()

# Clone a repository
git_clone("https://github.com/user/repo.git", branch="main")

# Stage files
git_add("file.txt")  # Single file
git_add(["*.py", "docs/"])  # Multiple files/patterns

# Commit changes
git_commit("feat: Add new feature")

# Push to remote
git_push("origin", "main", set_upstream=True)

# Pull changes
git_pull("origin", "main")

# View commit history
logs = git_log(limit=20, oneline=False)

# Branch operations
git_branch(create="feature/new-feature")  # Create branch
git_checkout("feature/new-feature")  # Switch branch
branches = git_branch()  # List branches
git_branch(delete="old-branch")  # Delete branch

# View differences
diff = git_diff()  # Working directory changes
diff = git_diff(cached=True)  # Staged changes

# Remote management
remotes = git_remote()  # List remotes
git_remote(action="add", name="upstream", url="https://github.com/upstream/repo.git")
git_remote(action="remove", name="old-remote")
```

#### Git on Remote Servers

Git operations work seamlessly on remote servers via SSH:

```python
# Connect to remote server
set_project_directory(
    path="/home/user/project",
    connection_type="ssh",
    ssh_host="server.example.com",
    ssh_username="user"
)

# All git operations now work on the remote server
status = git_status()  # Check remote repository status
git_add("*.js")  # Stage files on remote
git_commit("fix: Update configuration")  # Commit on remote
git_push()  # Push from remote to its origin
```

**Git Features:**
- Full git command support (status, add, commit, push, pull, etc.)
- Works identically on local and remote repositories
- Branch management (create, switch, delete)
- Remote repository management
- Commit history with detailed information
- Diff viewing for changes
- No git installation needed on Claude's side

## Practical Claude Desktop Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing and Refactoring a Python Project

**User**: "Can you help me refactor this Python project in /Users/me/projects/webapp?"

**Claude**:
```python
# First, I'll set the project directory to work with your files
set_project_directory("/Users/me/projects/webapp")

# Let me explore the project structure
files = list_files(recursive=True, pattern="*.py")
# Found: app.py, models.py, utils.py, tests/test_app.py, etc.

# Let's look at the main application file
content = read_file("app.py")
# I can see this is a Flask application with some issues...

# Let me check the code structure
structure = get_code_structure("app.py")
# Found 15 functions, 3 classes, various imports

# Search for potential issues
results = search_files("TODO|FIXME|XXX", pattern="*.py")
# Found 8 TODOs across different files

# Let's refactor the database connection function
patch_file(
    "app.py",
    patches=[{
        "find": "def get_db():\n    return sqlite3.connect('database.db')",
        "replace": "def get_db():\n    \"\"\"Get database connection with proper error handling.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n        conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n        return conn\n    except sqlite3.Error as e:\n        current_app.logger.error(f'Database connection failed: {e}')\n        raise"
    }]
)

# Create a new configuration file
create_file(
    "config.py",
    content='''"""Application configuration."""
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

class Config:
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'dev-key-change-this'
    DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///app.db'
    DEBUG = os.environ.get('DEBUG', 'False').lower() == 'true'
'''
)
```

### Example 2: Deploying a Web Application to a Remote Server

**User**: "I need to deploy my React app to my VPS at server.example.com"

**Claude**:
```python
# First, let's connect to your remote server
set_project_directory(
    path="/var/www/myapp",
    connection_type="ssh",
    ssh_host="server.example.com",
    ssh_username="deploy",
    ssh_port=22
)

# Check what's currently on the server
files = list_files()
# I see there's an old version deployed...

# Create a backup of the current deployment
create_file("backup_timestamp.txt", datetime.now().isoformat())
move_file("current", f"backup_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}")

# Now let's upload your built React app
# First, let me check your local build
set_project_directory("/Users/you/projects/react-app", connection_type="local")

# Make sure you have a fresh build
local_files = list_files("build", recursive=True)
# Good, I can see the build directory with all assets

# Switch back to SSH and upload
set_project_directory(
    "ssh://deploy@server.example.com/var/www/myapp",
    connection_type="ssh"
)

# Upload the entire build directory
result = ssh_upload(
    local_path="/Users/you/projects/react-app/build",
    remote_path="current",
    recursive=True,
    overwrite=True
)
# Uploaded 156 files successfully

# Set proper permissions
for html_file in list_files("current", pattern="*.html"):
    # Note: You might need to run chmod via SSH separately
    pass

# Create/update the nginx configuration
config_content = read_file("/etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp")
# Let me update the configuration...
```

### Example 3: Analyzing Logs Across Multiple Servers

**User**: "I need to investigate an issue that happened yesterday across our three web servers"

**Claude**:
```python
# I'll help you gather and analyze logs from all three servers

# Server 1 - Web Frontend
set_project_directory(
    "ssh://admin@web1.example.com/var/log",
    connection_type="ssh"
)

# Search for errors in yesterday's logs
error_logs = search_files(
    "ERROR|CRITICAL|Exception",
    pattern="*.log",
    recursive=True
)
# Found 45 matches in nginx/error.log and app/production.log

# Download yesterday's logs for detailed analysis
result = ssh_download(
    remote_path="nginx/access.log.1",
    local_path="/tmp/analysis/web1_access.log"
)

# Server 2 - API Backend
set_project_directory(
    "ssh://admin@api.example.com/var/log",
    connection_type="ssh"
)

# Check for database connection errors
db_errors = search_files(
    "connection refused|timeout|Connection reset",
    pattern="postgresql*.log"
)
# Found 12 connection timeout errors between 14:30-14:45

# Download the specific time range
result = ssh_download(
    remote_path="app/api.log",
    local_path="/tmp/analysis/api.log"
)

# Server 3 - Background Workers
set_project_directory(
    "ssh://admin@worker.example.com/var/log",
    connection_type="ssh"
)

# Check for job failures
job_failures = search_files(
    "Job.*failed|Task.*error",
    pattern="worker*.log"
)

# Now analyze locally
set_project_directory("/tmp/analysis", connection_type="local")

# Correlate timestamps across all logs
all_logs = list_files(pattern="*.log")
for log_file in all_logs:
    content = read_file(log_file['name'])
    # ... analyze and correlate events
```

### Example 4: Maintaining Configuration Files Across Environments

**User**: "I need to update configuration files across dev, staging, and production environments"

**Claude**:
```python
# Let's create a systematic approach to managing your configurations

# First, let's work with your configuration templates locally
set_project_directory("/Users/you/configs", connection_type="local")

# Create a base configuration template
create_file(
    "base_config.yaml",
    content="""# Base configuration for all environments
app:
  name: MyApplication
  version: 2.1.0
  
logging:
  level: INFO

"""
)

# Create environment-specific overrides
environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
for env in environments:
    create_file(
        f"{env}_config.yaml",
        content=f"""# {env.title()} environment configuration

  debug: {'true' if env == 'dev' else 'false'}
"""
    )

# Now deploy to each environment
servers = {
    "dev": "dev.example.com",
    "staging": "staging.example.com",
    "prod": "prod1.example.com"
}

for env, host in servers.items():
    # Connect to the server
    set_project_directory(
        f"ssh://deploy@{host}/etc/myapp",
        connection_type="ssh"
    )
    
    # Backup existing configuration
    if await file_exists("config.yaml"):
        copy_file("config.yaml", f"config.yaml.backup.{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}")
    
    # Upload the new configuration
    result = ssh_upload(
        local_path=f"/Users/you/configs/{env}_config.yaml",
        remote_path="config.yaml"
    )
    
    # Verify the upload
    content = read_file("config.yaml")
    print(f"✓ Updated configuration on {env} server")
```

### Example 5: Collaborative Code Review and Fixes

**User**: "Can you review my code and fix any security issues you find?"

**Claude**:
```python
# Let's do a comprehensive security review of your codebase
set_project_directory("/Users/you/projects/webapp")

# First, let's search for common security issues

# 1. Check for hardcoded secrets
secrets_search = search_files(
    "password.*=.*['\"]|api_key.*=.*['\"]|secret.*=.*['\"]|token.*=.*['\"]",
    pattern="*.py,*.js,*.env*"
)
# Found potential hardcoded secrets in config.py and test_api.py

# 2. Look for SQL injection vulnerabilities
sql_issues = search_files(
    "execute\(.*%.*%|execute\(.*format\(|execute\(.*\+.*",
    pattern="*.py"
)
# Found 3 potential SQL injection points

# Let's fix the SQL injection in user.py
patch_file(
    "models/user.py",
    patches=[{
        "find": 'cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = \'{email}\'")',
        "replace": 'cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = %s", (email,))'
    }]
)

# 3. Check for missing input validation
validation_check = list_functions("routes.py")
# I'll examine each route handler...

    }]
)

# 4. Create a security configuration file

#### Searching Across Files

**User**: "Find all TODO comments in my Python files"

**Claude**:
```python
# I'll search for TODO comments across all Python files
todos = search_files(
    pattern="TODO|FIXME|XXX",
    file_pattern="*.py",
    recursive=True
)

# Found 12 TODOs:
# app.py:45 - TODO: Add error handling for database connection
# app.py:89 - TODO: Implement rate limiting
# models.py:23 - FIXME: This query is not optimized
# utils.py:67 - TODO: Add unit tests for this function
# ...
```

#### Backing Up and Restoring

**User**: "Create a backup of my entire project directory"

**Claude**:
```python
# I'll create a timestamped backup of your project
from datetime import datetime

backup_name = f"backup_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"

# Create backup directory
create_file(f"../{backup_name}/.backup_info", f"Backup created at {datetime.now()}")

# Copy all files
files = list_files(recursive=True)
for file in files:
    if file['type'] == 'file':
        content = read_file(file['name'])
        write_file(f"../{backup_name}/{file['name']}", content)
        
# Backup created successfully at ../{backup_name}/
```

#### Working with Multiple Files

**User**: "Replace all instances of 'http://' with 'https://' in all my config files"

**Claude**:
```python
# I'll update all config files to use HTTPS
result = replace_in_files(
    search="http://",
    replace="https://",
    file_pattern="*.conf,*.json,*.yaml,*.yml",
    recursive=True
)

# Updated 8 files:
# - config.json: 3 replacements
# - app.conf: 2 replacements  
# - settings.yaml: 1 replacement
# ...
# Total: 15 replacements across 8 files
```

#### Analyzing Code Structure

**User**: "Show me all the functions in my main.py file"

**Claude**:
```python
# I'll analyze the code structure of main.py
functions = list_functions("main.py")

# Found 12 functions in main.py:
# 1. initialize_app() - Line 10-25: Sets up the application
# 2. connect_database() - Line 28-45: Establishes database connection
# 3. authenticate_user() - Line 48-72: Handles user authentication
# 4. process_request() - Line 75-95: Main request handler
# ...

# Let me also show you the overall structure
structure = get_code_structure("main.py")
# File structure:
# - Imports: 8 (flask, sqlalchemy, ...)
# - Classes: 3 (App, Database, UserAuth)
# - Functions: 12
# - Total lines: 450
```

#### Git Version Control

**User**: "Initialize git for this project and make the first commit"

**Claude**:
```python
# I'll initialize git and create your first commit

# Initialize the repository
result = git_init()
# Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/you/project/.git/

# Check current status
status = git_status()
# Untracked files: app.py, README.md, requirements.txt, config.json

**User**: "Create a new feature branch and push it to GitHub"

**Claude**:
```python

# First, let's add the GitHub remote
git_remote(
    action="add",
    name="origin",
    url="https://github.com/yourusername/project.git"
