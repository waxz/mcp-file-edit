# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `str_replace_based_edit_tool`: new MCP tool implementing Anthropic's native
  text-editor protocol (`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`,
  `undo_edit`) so Claude models can edit files using the exact tool shape
  they are trained on, alongside the existing Codex-style `apply_patch`
  (OpenAI-compatible) unified-diff tool. Both tools share the same project
  directory, path-safety checks, and file backend, so they can be mixed
  freely against the same files.
- Per-file `undo_edit` history for edits made through
  `str_replace_based_edit_tool` (bounded to the last 50 edits per file).

## [1.3.1] - 2025-06-30

### Changed
- Refactored `ssh_sync` to use rsync for efficient file synchronization
- Added `update_only` parameter (default: True) to only update files if source is newer
- Added `show_progress` parameter (default: True) to display rsync progress output
- Improved performance for large directory synchronizations through rsync compression

### Added  
- Real-time progress tracking during sync operations
- Support for exclude patterns in sync operations
- Detailed rsync command output in sync results

## [1.3.0] - 2025-06-30

### Added
- Comprehensive git operations for both local and remote repositories:
  - `git_status`: Check repository status
  - `git_init`: Initialize new repositories
  - `git_clone`: Clone remote repositories
  - `git_add`: Stage files for commit
  - `git_commit`: Commit changes with messages
  - `git_push`: Push commits to remote
  - `git_pull`: Pull changes from remote
  - `git_log`: View commit history
  - `git_branch`: Manage branches (create, delete, list)
  - `git_checkout`: Switch branches or commits
  - `git_diff`: View changes (working or staged)
  - `git_remote`: Manage remote repositories
  - Full support for git operations on remote servers via SSH
  - No git installation required on Claude's side

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-30

### Added
- SSH file transfer operations:
  - `ssh_upload`: Upload files from local to remote filesystem
  - `ssh_download`: Download files from remote to local filesystem  
  - `ssh_sync`: Synchronize directories between local and remote
  - Support for single file and recursive directory transfers
  - Automatic directory creation and overwrite control
  - Progress tracking with file counts and total size
  - Detailed error reporting for failed transfers

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-30

### Added
- SSH support for remote filesystem operations:
  - Connect using SSH URL format: `ssh://user@host:port/path`
  - Key-based authentication (no password prompts)
  - All file operations work transparently over SSH
  - No tools required on remote server
  - Efficient SFTP protocol for file transfers
- File operations abstraction layer:
  - `FileOperationsInterface` for consistent API
  - `LocalFileOperations` for local filesystem
  - `SSHFileOperations` for remote operations
- SSH connection management with automatic reconnection
- Enhanced `set_project_directory` with connection type parameter

### Changed
- All file operations now use async abstraction layer
- Improved error messages for remote operations
- Path handling now supports both local and remote contexts

## [1.0.1] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- Code analysis features for understanding code structure:
  - `list_functions` - Extract all functions with signatures and line numbers
  - `get_function_at_line` - Find function containing a specific line
  - `get_code_structure` - Extract imports, classes, and functions
  - `search_functions` - Search for functions by name pattern
- Support for Python and JavaScript code analysis
- Function signature extraction with type hints
- Docstring extraction and parsing

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- Initial release of MCP File Edit server
- Comprehensive file operations (read, write, create, delete, move, copy)
- Directory operations with recursive support
- Pattern-based file search with regex support
- Find and replace across multiple files
- Advanced patch functionality with multiple patch types:
  - Line-based patches for specific line modifications
  - Pattern-based patches for find/replace operations
  - Context-based patches for safer modifications
- Project directory support for simplified relative paths
- Depth limiting for recursive operations
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Binary file support with base64 encoding
- Path traversal protection
- Automatic backup creation before modifications
- Dry-run mode for previewing changes
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting

### Security

- All operations restricted to base directory
- Safe handling of symbolic links
- Input validation for all file operations
